 where
   -- Exception handling in unsafePerformIO does not happen like you're
   -- used to in normal code. Specifically:
   --
   -- * If a thread running unsafePerformIO code catches an asynchronous
   --   exception, the stack is unwound until the first matching exception
   --   handler as per normal, but if that unwinds it past the invocation
   --   of the unsafePerformIO thunk, the entire state of the code running
   --   in it is saved for later use. If the thunk is later re-entered, it
   --   "unpauses" the code and it continues from where it stopped.
   -- * If the code throws a normal exception, eg. throw/throwIO/pattern
   --   match failure, etc. past the invocation thunk, the thunk is altered
   --   to immediately throw that same exception if it is ever re-entered.
   --
   -- These are both normally good things for efficiency reasons. It
   -- presents us with a pickle when implementing unamb, however:
   --
   -- * unamb is implemented by calling race, which creates threads that
   --   it kills once it completes, for any reason, including exceptions.
   -- * As invocations of unamb are often recursive, this means that
   --   invocations of unamb are often killed by asynchronous exceptions.
   -- * The normal "unpausing" behavior of unsafePerformIO would have them
   --   keep trying to read a dead MVar, whose writers are now-dead threads.
   --
   -- To fix this, we want to restart the action entirely when we catch an
   -- exception.
   --
   -- We do this by adding this exception handler, which instead of returning
   -- normally retries the action at the end. We do of course want to throw
   -- the exception on; however, we can't use throw/throwIO (as that would
   -- make the thunk record itself as bottom), therefore we use throwTo
   -- instead.
   --
   -- Ensuring that the code doesn't execute the retry before the exception
   -- is propagated, throwTo doesn't return until the exception has been
   -- handled.
   --
   -- Incidentally, all exception handlers run inside an implicit block, and
   -- blocking operations contain an implicit unblock. This ensures that any
   -- further pending exceptions won't mess this scheme up, as they can't be
   -- delivered until after throwTo has been called.

--                 killThread tb
--                 return x

-- The simple version doesn't recursively kill descendent threads when
-- killed, which leads to a lot of wasted work.

-- Here is an improved version, based on suggestions from Sterling Clover
-- and Bertram Felgenhauer.  It takes care to kill children when killed.
-- Importantly, it also sets itself up to be retried if the unamb value is
-- accessed again after its computation is aborted.

-- race a b = block $ do
--    v <- newEmptyMVar
--    let f x = forkIO (unblock (putCatch x v))
--    ta <- f a
--    tb <- f b
--    let cleanup = killThread ta >> killThread tb
--    (do r <- takeMVar v; cleanup; return r) `catch`
--        \e -> do cleanup

-- This version kills descendant threads when killed, but does not restart
-- any work if it's called by unamb. That code is left in unamb.
